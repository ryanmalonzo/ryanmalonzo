### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Malonzo. I am a Computer Science student at Paris Dauphine University.

I am a future web & data developer.  
Projects I like working on include creating websites as well as automating tasks related to my hobbies, such as [scraping and analyzing data from my video games](https://github.com/yusa-ai/genshin-pity-counter) or [tracking my order shipments](https://github.com/yusa-ai/package-tracker).
