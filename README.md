### Hi there üëã

My name is Ryan Malonzo. I am a fourth year Web Engineering student at ESGI Paris.

As a web developer, I take great pleasure in enhancing my skills using my favorite languages and I always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and new technologies.  

React is my main working tool for front-end work. I also use Python (‚ù§Ô∏è) for occasional back-end tasks as well as my personal projects.
