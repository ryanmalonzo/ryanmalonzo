### Hi there üëã

My name is Ryan Malonzo. I am a fifth year Web Engineering student at ESGI Paris and a Software Engineer apprentice at PayFit.  

As a web developer, I take great pleasure in enhancing my skills using my favorite languages and I always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and new technologies.  

React is my main working tool for front-end work. I also use Python (‚ù§Ô∏è) for occasional back-end tasks as well as my personal projects.  

Last learned (updated 08-22-2024):
- TypeScript
- Vue.js

Currently learning (last updated 08-22-2024):
- Next.js

One of my recent hobbies is taking care of my [self-hosted homelab](https://ryanmalonzo.fr) by keeping up with the latest trends, adding new apps and features that replace paid cloud services, and offering similar functionality that can be shared with family and friends. Please check it out!
